## 1. Introduction

The Firewalker LED light project was inspired by Becky Stern. It uses a small microcontroller called the Gemma M0(add sound?) and a string of multi-colored lights called the *NeoPixel*

At the Chatham Marconi Museum, we decided to use her ideas and parts list to make a set of lights that can be placed on a bike helmet or sewn to the front or back of a coat.

# 1. Introduction


The *'Firewalker' Protective Lights* uses the [Gemma M0](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gemma-m0) (a small microcontroller) and a string of multi-colored leds aligned on a strip. The LEDS are called the [NeoPixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels?embeds=allow).


## Making the *Firewalker Protective LEDs*

To prepare our *Firewalker Protective LEDs* we have X steps:

1. Join Scratch and Learn Programming Basics
2. Download & Install Windows driver
3. Download & Install .UF2
4. Download & Install Thonny
5. Download & Install Circup
6. Setup Python on your computer,

## Day 2: Bridging to Python - Concepts & Syntax

**Objective**: Transition from visual blocks to text-based code, understanding how Scratch concepts translate into Python syntax.

### Concept Translation & Python Introduction
   * Review Scratch Concepts: Briefly recap sequencing, loops, and conditionals.
   * "Bridge" Scratch blocks to text commands.
   * Introduction to Python:
      * What is Python? Where is it used (web, data, AI)?
      * Setting up a basic Python environment (e.g., online interpreter, simple IDE like Thonny).
      * Basic Python Syntax:
         * print() function for output.
         * Variables: Storing data (e.g., name = "Alice", age = 12).
         * Data Types: Numbers (integers, floats) and Strings.
         * Arithmetic Operations: +, -, *, /.
   * Hands-on Activity: Write simple Python scripts to print messages, store values in variables, and perform basic calculations.
* Python Control Flow
   * Loops in Python:
      * for loops (e.g., iterating through a range of numbers).
      * while loops (e.g., repeating until a condition is met).
      * Hands-on Activity: Write programs that use loops (e.g., counting, simple patterns).
   * Conditionals in Python:
      * if, elif, else statements for decision-making.
      * Hands-on Activity: Create a simple "choose your own adventure" text game or a program that checks if a number is even/odd.
   * User Input:
      * Using the input() function to get data from the user.
   * Project: Develop a simple console-based Python game (e.g., a "guess the number" game, a simple calculator).

## Day 3: Microcontroller Programming with Python (Micro:bit)

**Objective: Apply Python knowledge to interact with physical hardware, bringing code to life.**

* Micro:bit Setup & Basic I/O
   * Introduction to Micro:bit:
      * What is a microcontroller? What can it do?
      * Overview of Micro:bit components (LED matrix, buttons, sensors, pins).
   * Setting up MicroPython:
      * Connect the Micro:bit.
      * Use the online Micro:bit Python editor or Thonny IDE.
      * Flashing MicroPython firmware (if necessary).
   * Basic Micro:bit Programming:
      * Displaying text and images on the LED matrix (display.scroll(), display.show()).
      * Reading button presses (button_a.is_pressed(), button_b.was_pressed()).
   * Hands-on Activity: Make the Micro:bit display a message, then change it when a button is pressed.
* Sensors & Final Project
   * Built-in Sensors:
      * Explore using the accelerometer (accelerometer.get_x(), get_y(), get_z()).
      * Light sensor (display.read_light()).
      * Temperature sensor (temperature()).
   * Combining Concepts: Integrate loops, conditionals, and sensor readings.
   * Project Development: Students choose and build a small project:
      * Digital Dice: Shake the Micro:bit to display a random number.
      * Light-Activated Alarm: Display a message or play a tune when it gets dark/light.
      * Step Counter: Use the accelerometer to count steps.
      * Rock, Paper, Scissors: Use button presses and display.
   * Showcase & Review: Students demonstrate their projects, discuss challenges and successes.
   * Next Steps: Resources for continued learning (online tutorials, other microcontrollers).
